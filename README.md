## Pre-requisites

* [Singularity v3.5.+](https://sylabs.io/docs/).

## Building the image using the recipe

### To build the image locally
Run the script `build.sh` to build image locally.

```
bash ./build.sh
```

### To build the image remotely remotely
Run the script `rbuild.sh` to build image remotely.

```

You will need to edit the script above to match your account on [SyLabs.io](https://sylabs.io/).
